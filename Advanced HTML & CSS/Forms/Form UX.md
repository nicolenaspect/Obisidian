## Tips And Tricks

1. The best place to show validation errors - near inputs. Don't gather all of them in one place.  ![[Pasted image 20230219145600.jpg]]

2. Don't disable the submit button. Allow users to click on it and see the validation errors. Users might scroll past some of the inputs without filling them. If the submit button is blocked, then they won't know what to do next.![[Pasted image 20230219145646.jpg]]

3. Consider providing positive feedback as well as negative.![[Pasted image 20230219145732.jpg]]

   4. Use human language, not a technical one ![[Pasted image 20230219145900.jpg]]


  5. If you put an exclamation icon next to inputs it might help colorblind people to notice the error.
