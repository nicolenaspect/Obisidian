## Frameworks Overview


Frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) do a lot of the heavy lifting of packaging up commonly used CSS code for you, even icons and interactions (like menu dropdowns).  A CSS framework is ultimately just a bundle of CSS that you can use and access, using the classes defined by the framework. For example, many frameworks provide a class called .btn that will add all the needed styles to your buttons, without you having to write any CSS. In general, all you have to do to use a framework is understand how it expects you to lay out your site, and which classes it uses to designate its particular batch of styles.

You should be aware that there are quite a few frameworks available to choose from. Two other frameworks to know about are [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [Foundation](https://get.foundation/). There are many more out there.
